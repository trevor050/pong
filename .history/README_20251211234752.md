# day / nite drift

this is a fork of marko denic's **dynamic pong wars**:  
https://github.com/markodenic/dynamic-pong-wars  
which itself is based on koen van gilst's original pong wars thing.

his is great but i just decided to make it look prettier so it can be a screensaver

## what's different vs dynamic-pong-wars
- **way more knobs**: speed mood dial, chaos slider, tile size/density slider, scatter start, swap sides, reset settings (without nuking the current board)
- **palette gallery** with a bunch of curated themes + custom day/night/accent pickers that autosave
- **ball style gallery** (glow, halo, soft core, grid lines, ghost trail, comet tail, sparkburst, etc)
- **drawer ui** so the sim stays clean; optional auto-hide chrome + hide score bar
- **its bigger** fullscreen baby
- split into `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js` instead of one file
- small perf cleanups **without touching physics**: cached ball palettes + tile drawing grouped into runs (fewer canvas calls), removed a dead `drawTile` helper
- lil custom favicon

none of the collision / takeover rules are changed on purpose — that part is already perfect.

## controls
- top-left buttons: play/pause, reset, settings
- drawer buttons: scatter start, swap sides, fullscreen, reset settings
- hotkeys: `space` = play/pause, `s` = toggle settings

---

## run locally
```bash
npx serve
```
then open the served `index.html`.

or just literally open the index.html file in your web browser of choice (its works with chromium, firefox, and safari based browsers from what ive tested)
